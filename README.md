# Producer-Consumer Problem
This solution explains how to solve producer-consumer problem using Java threads.

I used Runnable interface for creatation of Producer and Consumer class. 

Producer inserts an element to queue. (produces)
Consumer remove element from queue. (consumes)

If queue is full, producer waits. If queue is empty, consumer waits.
